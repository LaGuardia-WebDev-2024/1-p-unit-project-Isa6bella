    <p>
      She gained popularity in Thailand through social media clips of her trying
      to bite zoo keepers. <br> Her fame quickly grew on Western social media and all
      over. <mark> <br> The world cannot get enough of this baby hippo! </mark>
    </p>
    In the wild, <em>Pygmy Hippopotamus (Moo Deng's Species) </em> prefer to
    live alone, <br />
    and even avoid eachother all together.
